/*
Write a function that counts how many different ways you can make change for an amount of money, given an array of coin denominations. For example, there are 3 ways to give change for 4 if you have coins with denomination 1 and 2:

1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 2+2.
The order of coins does not matter:

1+1+2 == 2+1+1
Also, assume that you have an infinite amount of coins.

Your function should take an amount to change and an array of unique denominations for the coins:

  countChange(4, [1,2]) // => 3
  countChange(10, [5,2,3]) // => 4
  countChange(11, [5,7]) //  => 0
*/

function countChange(money, coins) {
  const dp = Array(money + 1).fill(0);
  dp[0] = 1;
  for (const coin of coins)
    for (let i = coin; i <= money; i++) dp[i] += dp[i - coin];
  return dp[money];
}
