For example, if you flip a coin 100 times, you'll probably see four heads or four tails in a row during that time.</p><p>But if that happens in a game, the player tends to think that the game is "broken" and will get frustrated.</p><p>The task here is to implement a new random number generator called <code>RNG</code> that follows different rules.</p><p>The constructor will take a parameter, <code>n</code>, which gives the upper bound. The generator will output integers between 0 and <code>n</code> (not including <code>n</code>).</p><p>The <code>rand</code> method will output the next random number.</p><p><code>rand</code> will work in cycles of length <code>n</code>, and during each cycle, it will output every possible number. So if <code>n</code> = 2, then the sequences:</p><pre><code>1, 0, 1, 00, 1, 0, 10, 1, 1, 01, 0, 0, 1</code></pre><p>are all possible, but </p><pre><code>1, 1, 0, 11, 1, 1, 10, 0, 0, 1</code></pre><p>are not possible, because they do not output every number in each cycle.</p><p>Note: The test suite includes a mean and variance test on one value in each cycle. There is an outside chance that a correct implementation will fail these tests. If you fail them by a small margin, just run the test again.</p>
