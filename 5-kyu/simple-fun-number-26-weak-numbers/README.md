It follows that the weaker the number, the greater overall weakness it has.</p><p>For the given integer <code>n</code>, you need to answer two questions:</p><ul><li>what is the weakness of the weakest numbers in the range <code>[1, n]</code>?</li><li>how many numbers in the range [1, n] have this weakness?</li></ul><p>Return the answer as a tuple ( where applicable: array ) of two elements, where the first element is the answer to the first question, and the second element is the answer to the second question.</p><h1 id="example">Example</h1><p>For <code>n = 9</code>, the output should be <code>[2, 2]</code></p><p>Here are the number of divisors and the specific weaknesses of each number in range <code>[1, 9]</code>:</p><pre><code>1: d(1) = 1, weakness(1) = 0;2: d(2) = 2, weakness(2) = 0;3: d(3) = 2, weakness(3) = 0;4: d(4) = 3, weakness(4) = 0;5: d(5) = 2, weakness(5) = 1;6: d(6) = 4, weakness(6) = 0;7: d(7) = 2, weakness(7) = 2;8: d(8) = 4, weakness(8) = 0;9: d(9) = 3, weakness(9) = 2.</code></pre><p>As you can see, the maximum weakness is <code>2</code>, and there are <code>2</code> numbers with that weakness.</p><h1 id="inputoutput">Input/Output</h1><ul><li><code>[input]</code> integer <code>n</code><br> Constraints: <code>1 ≤ n ≤ 1000</code></li><li><code>[output]</code> a pair of integers ( see example tests what encoding is actually required )<br> the weakness of the weakest number, and the number of integers in range <code>[1, n]</code> with this weakness</li></ul>
