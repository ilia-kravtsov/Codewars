The result is the length of that substring.</p><p> For example:</p><pre><code>"()()(" =&gt; 4Because "()()" is the longest substring, which has a length of 4</code></pre><h1 id="note">Note:</h1><ul><li>All inputs are valid.</li><li>If no such substring found, return 0.</li><li>Please pay attention to the performance of code. ;-)</li><li>In the performance test(100000 brackets str x 100 testcases), the time consuming of each test case should be within 35ms. This means, your code should run as fast as a rocket ;-)</li></ul><h1 id="some-examples">Some Examples</h1><pre><code> "" =&gt; 0"()" =&gt; 2"()(" =&gt; 2"()()" =&gt; 4"()()(" =&gt; 4"(()())" =&gt; 6"(()(())" =&gt; 6"())(()))" =&gt; 4"))((" =&gt; 0</code></pre>
