A special kind of permutation is the one that has all of its elements in a different position than the original.</p><p>Let's see how many of these permutations may be generated from an array of four elements. We put the original array with square brackets and the wanted permutations with parentheses. </p><pre><code>arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]      (2, 1, 4, 3)      (2, 3, 4, 1)      (2, 4, 1, 3)      (3, 1, 4, 2)      (3, 4, 1, 2)      (3, 4, 2, 1)      (4, 1, 2, 3)      (4, 3, 1, 2)      (4, 3, 2, 1)      _____________A total of 9 permutations with all their elements in different positions than arr</code></pre><p>The task for this kata would be to create a code to count all these permutations for an array of certain length.</p><p>Features of the random tests:</p><pre><code>l = length of the array10 ≤ l ≤ 5000</code></pre><p>See the example tests.</p><p>Enjoy it!</p>
