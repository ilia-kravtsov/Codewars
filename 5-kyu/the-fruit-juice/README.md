We can add some components with certain amounts. Sometimes we pour out a bit of our juice. Then we want to find out, which concentrations our fruit juice has.</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li>You take an empty jar for your juice</li><li>Whenever the jar is empty, the concentrations are always 0</li><li>Now you add 200 units of apple juice</li><li>And then you add 200 units of banana juice</li><li>Now the concentration of apple juice is 0.5 (50%)</li><li>Then you pour out 200 units</li><li>The concentration of apple juice is still 50%</li><li>Then you add 200 units of apple juice again</li><li>Now the concentration of apple juice is 0.75, while the concentration of banana juice is only 0.25 (300 units apple juice + 100 units banana juice)</li></ul><p>Complete the functions in order to provide this functionality. The test code for the example above can be found in the test fixture.</p>
