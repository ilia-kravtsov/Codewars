Unfortunately his power is pretty low, so he needs to find the shortest way from his Start point (S) to the Target cell (T).</p><p>When Robby starts, he always looks into north direction. He has a limited command set and each command costs him 1 unit of power. The commands are:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="cm-variable">Commands</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> {  <span class="cm-string cm-property">"TURN_RIGHT"</span>: <span class="cm-string">"r"</span>, <span class="cm-comment">// turn right by 90°</span>  <span class="cm-string cm-property">"TURN_LEFT"</span>: <span class="cm-string">"l"</span>, <span class="cm-comment">// turn left by 90°</span>  <span class="cm-string cm-property">"MOVE_FORWARDS"</span>: <span class="cm-string">"f"</span> <span class="cm-comment">// move one field forwards into current direction</span>};</code></pre><p>The field, Robby is moving on, is defined by a string, which may have different dimensions, but is always squared.</p><p>Example for a 3x3 field:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="cm-variable">field</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string">'S.......T'</span>;<span class="cm-comment">// which means:</span><span class="cm-variable">field</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span>  <span class="cm-string">'S..'</span> <span class="cm-operator">+</span>  <span class="cm-string">'...'</span> <span class="cm-operator">+</span>  <span class="cm-string">'..T'</span>;</code></pre><p>Each cell of the field is described by a character:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="cm-variable">Fields</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> {  <span class="cm-string cm-property">"WALKABLE"</span>: <span class="cm-string">"."</span>, <span class="cm-comment">// Robby may walk on this</span>  <span class="cm-string cm-property">"BLOCKED"</span>: <span class="cm-string">"#"</span>, <span class="cm-comment">// Robby must not walk on this</span>  <span class="cm-string cm-property">"START"</span>: <span class="cm-string">"S"</span>, <span class="cm-comment">// Robby is starting here, he may also walk here</span>  <span class="cm-string cm-property">"TARGET"</span>: <span class="cm-string">"T"</span> <span class="cm-comment">// The target cell, Robby has to reach</span>};</code></pre><p>Your task is to write a function, which returns the list of commands, Robby has to do in order to reach the target cell and save as much power as possible. If Robby is not able to reach the target with the remaining power, the function should return an empty list.</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="cm-variable">getCommands</span>(<span class="cm-string">'T.S.'</span>, <span class="cm-number">5</span>); <span class="cm-comment">// -&gt; ['f'], because he just has to move forward</span><span class="cm-variable">getCommands</span>(<span class="cm-string">'S.......T'</span>, <span class="cm-number">10</span>); <span class="cm-comment">// -&gt; ['r', 'f', 'f', 'r', 'f', 'f']</span><span class="cm-variable">getCommands</span>(<span class="cm-string">'S.......T'</span>, <span class="cm-number">5</span>); <span class="cm-comment">// -&gt; [], because he needs at least 6 units of power</span><span class="cm-variable">getCommands</span>(<span class="cm-string">'S#.##...T'</span>, <span class="cm-number">20</span>); <span class="cm-comment">// =&gt; [], because the target can not be reached (with an arbitrary amount of power)</span></code></pre><p>Additional notes:</p><ul><li>There is exactly one Start point (S)</li><li>There is exactly one Target point (T)</li><li>Each test case has exactly one solution (= only one shortest command list)</li></ul>
