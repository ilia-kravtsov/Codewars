"123"He converted each digit into English words.ie. "123"--&gt; "ONETWOTHREE"And then, rearrange the letters randomly.ie. "ONETWOTHREE" --&gt; "TTONWOHREEE"</code></pre><p>John felt that his number were safe in doing so. In fact, such encryption can be easily decrypted :(</p><p>Given the encrypted string <code>s</code>, your task is to decrypt it, return the original number in string format.</p><p>Note, You can assume that the input string <code>s</code> is always valid; It contains only uppercase Letters; The decrypted numbers are arranged in ascending order; The leading zeros are allowed.</p><h1 id="example">Example</h1><p>For <code>s = "ONE"</code>, the output should be <code>1</code>.</p><p>For <code>s = "EON"</code>, the output should be <code>1</code> too.</p><p>For <code>s = "ONETWO"</code>, the output should be <code>12</code>.</p><p>For <code>s = "OONETW"</code>, the output should be <code>12</code> too.</p><p>For <code>s = "ONETWOTHREE"</code>, the output should be <code>123</code>.</p><p>For <code>s = "TTONWOHREEE"</code>, the output should be <code>123</code> too.</p>
