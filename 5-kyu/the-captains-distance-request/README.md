The captain, by the name of Haversine, wants you to help him out:<em>"Arrr, we need to know the distance between these two points on the map, so I know how long we need to wait before we get to our beloved treasure!".</em>As this is the fourth of such requests by your captain, you decide to write a function to calculate the distance between two coordinates. </p><p>Complete the function so it returns the distance between two given coordinates. Examples of given coordinates are:</p><p>48° 12′ 30″ N, 16° 22′ 23″ E<br>23° 33′ 0″ S, 46° 38′ 0″ W<br>58° 18′ 0″ N, 134° 25′ 0″ W<br>33° 51′ 35″ S, 151° 12′ 40″ E</p><p>The returned distance should be in kilometers.<br>We think about the earth as a sphere with radius 6371 km.<br>As our captain has a good binocular and the fact, that we are lazy, we don't take precision too serious. So it is sufficient for the result to be precise up to 10 km.<br>You can expect the delivered coordinates to be valid.<br>The characters for minutes (′) and seconds (″) are not standard quotation marks, but following Unicode characters:</p><ul><li><code>°</code> - U+00B0 - Degree Sign</li><li><code>′</code> - U+2032 - Prime</li><li><code>″</code> - U+2033 - Double Prime</li></ul><h3 id="examples">Examples</h3><pre><code>| From                         | To                            | Approx. distance || 48° 12′ 30″ N, 16° 22′ 23″ E | 23° 33′ 0″  S,  46° 38′  0″ W | 10138            || 48° 12′ 30″ N, 16° 22′ 23″ E | 58° 18′ 0″  N, 134° 25′  0″ W | 7873             || 48° 12′ 30″ N, 16° 22′ 23″ E | 48° 12′ 30″ N,  16° 22′ 23″ E | 0                |</code></pre><p>As you try and try and just don't seem to be able to find the solution, the ship's first mate, an old white bearded man gives you a small hint:<em>"There are many ways to tackle the problem. Guess which one's the captain's favourite! His name was not given to him by accident!"</em></p><p>Good luck, navigator!</p>
