She also has many purses of different length, in which she carries the combs. The only way they fit is horizontally and without overlapping. Given teeth' positions on both combs, find the minimum length of the purse she needs to take them with her.</p><p> It is guaranteed that there is at least one tooth at each end of the comb. </p><ul><li>Note, that the combs can not be rotated/reversed.</li></ul><h1 id="example">Example</h1><p> For <code>comb1 = "*..*" and comb2 = "*.*"</code>, the output should be <code>5</code></p><p> Although it is possible to place the combs like on the first picture, the best way to do this is either picture 2 or picture 3.</p><p> <img alt="" src="https://codefightsuserpics.s3.amazonaws.com/tasks/combs/img/cbs.png?_tm=1484930552851"></p><h1 id="inputoutput">Input/Output</h1><ul><li><p><code>[input]</code> string <code>comb1</code></p><p>A comb is represented as a string.
