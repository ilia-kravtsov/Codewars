<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/599b1a4a3c5292b4cc0000d5/train/javascript target="_blank">Palindrome integer composition</a></h2><h3>5 kyu</h3><p>The palindromic number <code>595</code> is interesting because it can be written as the sum of consecutive squares: <code>6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 + 11^2 + 12^2 = 595</code>.</p><p>There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as consecutive square sums. Note that <code>1 = 0^2 + 1^2</code> has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares of positive integers.</p><p>Given an input <code>n</code>, find the count of all the numbers less than <code>n</code> that are both palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.</p><p>For instance: <code>values(1000) = 11</code>. See test examples for more cases.  </p><p>Good luck!</p><p>This Kata is borrowed from <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=125" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">Project Euler #125</a></p><p>If you like this Kata, please try:</p><p><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/59f0ee47a5e12962cb0000bf" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">Fixed length palindromes</a></p><p><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/59bf97cd4f98a8b1cd00007e" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">Divisor harmony</a></p>
