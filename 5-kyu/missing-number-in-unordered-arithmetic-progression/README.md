Try if you can survive lists of <strong>MASSIVE</strong> numbers (which means time limit should be considered). :D</p><p>Note: Don't be afraid that the minimum or the maximum element in the list is missing, e.g. [4, 6, 3, 5, 2] is missing 1 or 7, but this case is excluded from the kata.</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="cm-variable">find</span>([<span class="cm-number">3</span>, <span class="cm-number">9</span>, <span class="cm-number">1</span>, <span class="cm-number">11</span>, <span class="cm-number">13</span>, <span class="cm-number">5</span>]) <span class="cm-comment"># =&gt; 7</span></code></pre>
