A natural number is thus prime if and only if it is 1-prime.</p><pre><code>Examples:k = 2 -&gt; 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, …k = 3 -&gt; 8, 12, 18, 20, 27, 28, 30, …k = 5 -&gt; 32, 48, 72, 80, 108, 112, …</code></pre><h4 id="task">Task:</h4><p>Given an integer <code>k</code> and a list <code>arr</code> of positive integers the function <code>consec_kprimes (or its variants in other languages)</code> returnshow many times in the sequence <code>arr</code> numbers come up twice in a row with exactly <code>k</code> prime factors? </p><h4 id="examples">Examples:</h4><pre><code>arr = [10005, 10030, 10026, 10008, 10016, 10028, 10004]consec_kprimes(4, arr) =&gt; 3 because 10005 and 10030 are consecutive 4-primes, 10030 and 10026 too as well as 10028 and 10004 but 10008 and 10016 are 6-primes.consec_kprimes(4, [10175, 10185, 10180, 10197]) =&gt; 3 because 10175-10185 and 10185- 10180 and 10180-10197 are all consecutive 4-primes.</code></pre><h4 id="note">Note:</h4><p>It could be interesting to begin with:<a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/k-primes" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">https://www.codewars.com/kata/k-primes</a></p>
