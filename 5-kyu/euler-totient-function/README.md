Thus, if <code>n</code> is a positive integer, then <code>φ(n)</code>, notation introduced by Gauss in 1801, is the number of positive integers <code>k ≤ n</code> for which <code>gcd(n, k) = 1</code>.<br>The totient function is important in number theory, mainly because it gives the order of the multiplicative group of integers modulo <code>n</code>. The totient function also plays a key role in the definition of the RSA encryption system.</p><p>For example <code>let n = 9</code>.<br>Then <code>gcd(9, 3) = gcd(9, 6) = 3</code> and <code>gcd(9, 9) = 9</code>.<br>The other six numbers in the range <code>1 ≤ k ≤ 9</code> i.e. <code>1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8</code> are relatively prime to <code>9</code>.<br>Therefore, <code>φ(9) = 6</code>.<br>As another example, <code>φ(1) = 1</code> since <code>gcd(1, 1) = 1</code>.</p><p>There are generally two approaches to this function:</p><ul><li><p>Iteratively counting the numbers <code>k ≤ n</code> such that <code>gcd(n,k) = 1</code>.</p></li><li><p>Using the Euler product formula.<br>This is an explicit formula for calculating <code>φ(n)</code> depending on the prime divisor of <code>n</code>:<br><code>φ(n) = n * Product (1 - 1/p)</code> where the product is taken over the primes <code>p ≤ n</code> that divide <code>n</code>.<br>For example: <code>φ(36) = 36 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) = 36 * 1/2 * 2/3 = 12</code>.<br>This second method seems more complex and not likely to be faster, but in practice we will often look for <code>φ(n)</code> with <code>n</code> prime. It correctly gives <code>φ(n) = n - 1</code> if <code>n</code> is prime.</p></li></ul><p>You have to code the Euler totient function, that takes an integer <code>1 ≤ n</code> as input and returns <code>φ(n)</code>.</p><p>You do have to check if <code>n</code> is a number, is an integer and that <code>1 ≤ n</code>; if that is not the case, the function should return <code>0</code>.</p><p>Input range: <code>1 ≤ n ≤ 1e10</code></p>
