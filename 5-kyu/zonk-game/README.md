In each round the player rolls 6 dice. Then (s)he composes combinations of them. Each combination gives certain points. </p><p>Then player can take one or more dice combinations to their hand and re-roll remaining dice or save the score. Dice in the player's hand won't be taken into account in subsequent rolls.</p><p>If no combinations can be composed - the situation is called "zonk". The player who rolled zonk loses all points in that round and the next player takes a turn. So it's up to the player to decide when to re-roll and when to stop and keep their score.</p><p>Your task is simple - just evaluate  the current roll and return the maximum number of points that can be scored from it. If no combinations can be made, the function should return <code>0</code> (see Note below). The function should not modify the input.</p><p><em>Note: a previous version of this Kata required to return "Zonk" if no combinations possible, but mixing different return types is a bad practice. For backwards compatibility, "Zonk" is accepted as a valid result and is considered zero in some languages.</em></p><p>There are different variations of Zonk. In this kata, we will use most common table of combinations:</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Combination</td><td>Example roll</td><td>Points</td></tr><tr><td>Straight (1,2,3,4,5 and 6)</td><td>6 3 1 2 5 4</td><td>1000 points</td></tr><tr><td>Three pairs of any dice</td><td>2 2 4 4 1 1</td><td>750 points</td></tr><tr><td>Three of 1</td><td>1 4 1 1</td><td>1000 points</td></tr><tr><td>Three of 2</td><td>2 3 4 2 2</td><td>200 points</td></tr><tr><td>Three of 3</td><td>3 4 3 6 3 2</td><td>300 points</td></tr><tr><td>Three of 4</td><td>4 4 4</td><td>400 points</td></tr><tr><td>Three of 5</td><td>2 5 5 5 4</td><td>500 points</td></tr><tr><td>Three of 6</td><td>6 6 2 6</td><td>600 points</td></tr><tr><td>Four of a kind</td><td>1 1 1 1 4 6</td><td>2 × Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 2000 pts)</td></tr><tr><td>Five of a kind</td><td>5 5 5 4 5 5</td><td>3 × Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1500 pts)</td></tr><tr><td>Six of a kind</td><td>4 4 4 4 4 4</td><td>4 × Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1600 pts)</td></tr><tr><td>Every 1</td><td>4 3 1 2 2</td><td>100 points</td></tr><tr><td>Every 5</td><td>5 2 6</td><td>50 points</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Each die cannot be used in multiple combinations the same time, so three pairs of 2, 3 and 5 will worth you only <code>750</code> points (for three pairs), not 850 (for three pairs and two fives). But you can select multiple combinations, <code>2 2 2 1 6</code> will worth you <code>300</code> points (200 for three-of-kind <code>2</code> plus 100 for single <code>1</code> die)</p><h2>Examples:</h2><pre><code>[1,2,3]       =&gt;  returns 100  = points from one 1[3,4,1,1,5]   =&gt;  returns 250  = points from two 1 and one 5[2,3,2,3,3,2] =&gt;  returns 500  = three of 2 + three of 3[1,1,1,1,1,5] =&gt;  returns 3050 = five 1 + one 5[2,3,4,3,6,6] =&gt;  returns 0    = Zonk, no combinations here[2,2,6,6,2,2] =&gt;  returns 400  = four 2, this cannot be scored as three pairs[1,3,4,3,4,1] =&gt;  returns 750  = three pairs[3,3,3,3]     =&gt;  returns 600  = four of 3[1,2,3,4,5]   =&gt;  returns 150  = it's not straight</code></pre><p>Of course, in the real Zonk game it's sometimes not worth to collect all combination from a roll. Taking less dice and rerolling more remaining may be better, but this task is just to calculate the maximum possible score from a single roll.</p><p>P.S.
