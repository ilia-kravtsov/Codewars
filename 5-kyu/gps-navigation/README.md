Your map is a rather strange one too: all the intersections are labeled with distinct integers and the roads connecting them are labeled with the time they take to drive in minutes.</p><p>You are standing at the intersection labeled <strong>start</strong> and your destination is the intersection labeled <strong>finish</strong>.</p><p>You will be provided the total number of intersections and an array of roads, each with the properties <strong>from</strong>, <strong>to</strong> (both intersection labels; integers less than the number of intersections) and <strong>drivingTime</strong>. Roads may only be used to go from <strong>from</strong> to <strong>to</strong>. If there is no road going the other way it is a one-way street.</p><p>Complete the function <code>navigate(numberOfIntersections, roads, start, finish)</code> so that it returns an array of intersections on the fastest route from <strong>start</strong> to <strong>finish</strong> (including <strong>start</strong> and <strong>finish</strong>). </p><p>If there are several such routes, pick any. If there are no such routes, return null. </p><p>For example:</p><pre><code>var roads = [    {from: 0, to: 1, drivingTime: 5},    {from: 0, to: 2, drivingTime: 10},    {from: 1, to: 2, drivingTime: 10},    {from: 1, to: 3, drivingTime: 2},    {from: 2, to: 3, drivingTime: 2},    {from: 2, to: 4, drivingTime: 5},    {from: 3, to: 2, drivingTime: 2},    {from: 3, to: 4, drivingTime: 10}];navigate(5, roads, 0, 4); // should return [0, 1, 3, 2, 4]. Fastest time is 5 + 2 + 2 + 5 = 14 minutes</code></pre>
