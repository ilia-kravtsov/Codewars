You could also think of this as a zig-zag.</p><p>We want to visit the first level from left to right, the second level from right to left, third level from left to right, and so on...</p><p>The function will return a list of the visited nodes in serpentine order.</p><p>The tree is not necessarily balanced.It is very important that you start the first level from left to right!</p><p>A <code>Node</code> has 3 properties:<code>data</code> (a number or string)<code>left</code> (a reference to the left child)<code>right</code> (a refencence to the right child)</p><p>The empty reference if there is no child is <code>undefined</code> (JS) / <code>None</code> (Python)</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code>    A   /\  B  C /\  /\D E F G</code></pre><p>Should result in <code>["A", "C", "B", "D", "E", "F", "G"]</code></p>
