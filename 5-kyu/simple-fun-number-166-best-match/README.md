"Zamalek" managers want to know what is the best match they've played so far.</p><p>The best match is the match they lost with the minimum goal difference. If there is more than one match with the same difference, choose the one "Zamalek" scored more goals in.</p><p>Given the information about all matches they played, return the <code>index</code> of the best match (<code>0-based</code>). If more than one valid result, return the smallest index.</p><h1 id="example">Example</h1><p>For <code>ALAHLYGoals = [6,4] and zamalekGoals = [1,2]</code>, the output should be 1 (2 in COBOL).</p><p>Because <code>4 - 2</code> is less than <code>6 - 1</code></p><p>For <code>ALAHLYGoals = [1,2,3,4,5] and zamalekGoals = [0,1,2,3,4]</code>, the output should be 4.</p><p>The goal difference of all matches are 1, but at 4<sup>th</sup> match "Zamalek" scored more goals in. So the result is 4 (5 in COBOL).</p><h1 id="inputoutput">Input/Output</h1><ul><li><p><code>[input]</code> integer array <code>ALAHLYGoals</code><br>  The number of goals "AL-AHLY" scored in each match.</p></li><li><p><code>[input]</code> integer array <code>zamalekGoals</code><br>  The number of goals "Zamalek" scored in each match.
