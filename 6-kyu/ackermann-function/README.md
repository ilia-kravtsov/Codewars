Due to its definition in terms of extremely deep recursion it can be used as a benchmark of a compiler's ability to optimize recursion. </p><p>The goal of this kata is to code a function which will be given two inputs, m and n, and will return the Ackermann number A(m,n) defined by:</p><pre><code>A(m,n) = n+1                          if m=0  A(m,n) = A(m-1,1)                     if m&gt;0 , n=0A(m,n) = A(m-1,A(m,n-1))              if m,n &gt; 0</code></pre><p><code>m</code>,<code>n</code> should be non-negative integers, the function should return null (Javascript, Dart), None (Python), or nil (Ruby) for other type, non-integer and negative numbers. In C, input is restricted to integer type.</p>
