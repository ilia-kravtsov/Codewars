We are currently testing the system and it seems that the <code>launchAll</code> function does not work as expected. It should launch 5 missiles each  1 second apart. The current code tries to launch the missile #5 five times...</p><p>Can you fix this for us? You know, it's pretty critical code...</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: There are 5 missiles labeled <code>i</code> which is a number in {0, 1, 2, 3,  4}. The missile <code>i</code> should be launched after <code>i</code> seconds.</p>
