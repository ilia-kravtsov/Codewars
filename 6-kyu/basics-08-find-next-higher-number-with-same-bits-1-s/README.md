Input is always an int between 1 and 1&lt;&lt;30 (possibly inclusive). No bad cases or special tricks...</p><h3 id="some-easy-examples">Some easy examples:</h3><pre><code>Input: 129  =&gt; Output: 130 (10000001 =&gt; 10000010)Input: 127 =&gt; Output: 191 (01111111 =&gt; 10111111)Input: 1 =&gt; Output: 2 (01 =&gt; 10)Input: 323423 =&gt; Output: 323439 (1001110111101011111 =&gt; 1001110111101101111)</code></pre><p>First some static tests, later on many random tests too;-)!</p><h3 id="hope-you-have-fun--">Hope you have fun! :-)</h3>
