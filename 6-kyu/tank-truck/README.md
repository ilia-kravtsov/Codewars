The level indicator is down and he is worriedbecause he does not know if he will be able to make deliveries. We put the truck on a horizontal ground and measured the height of the liquid in the tank.</p><p>Fortunately the tank is a perfect cylinder and the vertical walls on each end are flat.The height of the remaining liquid is <code>h</code>, the diameter of the cylinder base is <code>d</code>,the total volume is <code>vt</code> (h, d, vt are positive or null integers). You can assume that <code>h</code> &lt;= <code>d</code>.</p><p>Could you calculate the remaining volume of the liquid?Your function <code>tankvol(h, d, vt)</code> returns an integer which is the truncated result (e.g floor)of your float calculation.</p><h4 id="examples">Examples:</h4><pre><code>tankvol(40,120,3500) should return 1021 (calculation gives about: 1021.26992027)tankvol(60,120,3500) should return 1750tankvol(80,120,3500) should return 2478 (calculation gives about: 2478.73007973)</code></pre><h4 id="tank-vertical-section">Tank vertical section:</h4><p><img alt="alternative text" src="http://i.imgur.com/wmt0U43.png"></p>
