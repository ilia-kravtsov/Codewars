/*
Write a function that given, an array arr, returns an array containing at each index i the amount of numbers that are smaller than arr[i] to the right.

For example:

* Input [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] => Output [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
* Input [1, 2, 0] => Output [1, 1, 0]
If you've completed this one and you feel like testing your performance tuning of this same kata, head over to the much tougher version How many are smaller than me II?
